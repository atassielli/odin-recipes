Add the broth, Marsala, heavy cream, thyme, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon of pepper; use a wooden spoon to scrape the brown bits from the pan into the liquid.

    <li><p>Add the chicken and any juices from the plate to the sauce and reduce the heat to low. Simmer unitl the chicken is warmed through and the sauce thickens a bit more, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.</p></li>
